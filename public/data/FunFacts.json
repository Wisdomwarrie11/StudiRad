    "weeklyFact": "Radiography helped discover the structure of DNA! In the early 1950s, scientists Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling used a technique called X-ray crystallography (a type of radiographic imaging) to photograph DNA. One of the images, famously known as 'Photo 51,' was critical in revealing the helical structure of DNA. This discovery paved the way for Watson and Crickâ€™s model of the DNA double helix!"
